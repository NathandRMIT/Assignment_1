<h3>Analysis</h3>
<p>
The results suggest that I would potentially struggle working in a team, though I am agreeable and am still able understand other points of view, I need to improve my social and communication skills as they are essential to being a valuable team member. My personality would make me unassertive in a team and I would be unwilling speak up about an idea or concern I have and would have an attitude of ‘going with the flow’ rather than taking more of a leadership role. 
I would need to take into account this confidence deficit when working in a team by being mindful of procrastination and actively engage in team dialogue.

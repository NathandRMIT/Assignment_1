  <h1><center>Interest in IT</center></h1>
  
  <p><center>
  My interest in IT is computer programming and how we interact with it in our everyday lives. Computer code is everywhere, and we deal with it every day, whenever we open our phone to check the weather or news, there is code behind it, whether it is HTML for a webpage or Python for an app, I want to become involved with putting together the code that makes a difference in peopleâ€™s lives. I learnt Computing and IT all through high school, in Year 12 I did a subject called Data Analytics, where we learned about problem-solving methodology and data analysis and mining as well as project management. In school I liked learning to write programs in HTML, as well as Java and Python. I chose RMIT because it is known for its STEM courses and would provide lots of opportunities for me to turn my interest in STEM into a career, my Dad also studied at RMIT. I expect that I will get to learn how be a good software engineer, I would also hope I can learn how to maintain and develop networks.</center></p>

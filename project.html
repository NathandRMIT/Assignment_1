  <h1><center>Project idea - Plugaway - A Mobile to-do list app</center></h1>
 
 <h3>Overview</h3>
 <p><img src="todo.jpg" alt="To-do" style="float:right;width:385px;height:216px;">Personal organisation is key to a successful and happy life, links have been found between poor organisation and poor mental health, 
 this project is intended set a stake in this issue. This project will be a mobile to-do list app, where users will have one task on the screen at a time so as to prevent the user from being overwhelmed with information and seeing a long list of tasks, 
 the project is designed to encourage users to focus on one task at a time and be more productive by breaking larger tasks into manageable chunks. The project would be entitled ‘Plugaway’ as it encourages users to ‘plug away’ at tasks. 
 
 
 <br>
  <br>
   
 <h3>Motivations</h3>
 This project could greatly be a step towards a much more productive and happier life and on a more macro-scale the entire economy. Though this app would improve a user’s mental health as well, as in 2011 a study from the Professional Organisers in Canada found that 7 in 10 disorganised Canadians reported feeling stressed or even worthless. Full time employees waste on average 76 hours a year due to disorganisation. These issues are interesting as they illustrate the effect of disorganisation on our everyday lives and not just our own but other around us and others we don’t even know.

 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 The user will open the app to an interface where they can write text in sequential text boxes, in here they would be writing out certain tasks that need to be completed for that particular day. There will be two buttons at the bottom of the interface. ‘Clear’ would reset the program and delete all items the user has inputted. The other button is ‘Start’ which would slide the user into another window which would display the text from the first textbox. Both buttons would use Python programming to operate as Python is the favoured language for mobile apps today as well as being commonly used for organisation applications such as Dropbox. There would be no option to cease with the list, this feature is intended to have users commit to their task and ensure they complete it, until the list is finished the users are locked into this section of the app. To indicate they have completed the task users would tap the screen for a large green tick to appear and obscure the text, green is associated positivity and getting things done and would make the interface visually appealing to the user. The interface will be designed to be as visually quiet as possible. White backgrounds will be used on all of the program’s interfaces so as to not distract the user from the app’s functions. 
 <br>
 <br>
<h3> Tools and Technologies</h3>
This entire project will be completed on a standard PC, the PC should have at least 8 GB of RAM, and processing speed of at least 1.6 GHz. This project will use Python Tkinter to be developed, Tkinter is an open-source Python developer for graphic user interfaces (GUI) such as this project. Tkinter allows for using visual elements to develop the interface itself before applying Python to those elements for functionality. This project will mainly utilise frames and buttons as well as labels to communicate with the user. These components will be appropriately programmed to keep the app as simple as possible to enhance the user experience. 
 
 <br>
 <br>
 <h3>Skills required</h3>
 An intermediate understanding of Python is required for the completion of this project, as well as an understanding of user-centred design. Python will be used to write the necessary software, which includes functions for buttons as well as permitting for users to input their own information. Good product management is essential in order grasp the users’ needs. Swift performance testing will also be required to ensure the consistent viability of the app. Some marketing abilities will be needed in order to sell this app’s merit to potentially undecided users. Acquiring the skills to complete this project is highly feasible. Today tutorials and forums are consistently available online to acquire skill in programming as well as troubleshooting.
 <br>
 <br>
 <h3>Outcome</h3>
 The successful completion of the project will result in a highly viable and unique but simple to-do list mobile application. This app would also be cross-platformed between iPhone and Android in order to broaden its user base. The app will solve the original issue with a user’s potentially poor personal organisation, by improving the organisation of a user it will improve the user’s mental health as well which will further increase productivity. Increased organisations among populations will increase productivity naturally, however productivity will further improve as mental health may improve as well, reflected by the link between organisation and mental health. These developments would massively improve productivity and economic activity.
